Help Habib's kebab stand flourish
> A Vue.js project

Kebab stand is inspired by Apple II's 1979 game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade_Stand">Lemonade Stand</a>. Similar to Lemonade stand, the player moves through several rounds of running a kebab stand ðŸ¥™ ðŸ¥™ ðŸ¥™. The player starts out with a fixed amount of money, and each day he/she must make the following business decisions:

<ul>
  <li>How many sandwiches to make each morning</li>
  <li>How many advertising signs to make (each sign is 95&cent)</li>
  <li>What price to charge for each sandwich</li>
</ul>

The objective of the game is to maximize profits and keep the kebab stand running as long as possible. But be careful! The results of the game are affected by random events such as bad weather.



## To play:

``` bash

##### Wish list:
<ul>
  <li>add feature to own & run multiple kebab stands</li>
  <li>allow for multiple players on a socket connection to compete or work together...and even form alliances!</li>
</ul>
