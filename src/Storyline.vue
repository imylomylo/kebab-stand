        <h3>Welcome to Habib's Shawarma Stand</h3>
        <p>Habib is feeling under the weather and he has asked you to run his shawarma stand.
         Should you choose to help Habib, you must make important decisions to help Habib's business thrive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How many sandwiches to make each morning</li>
            <li>How many advertising signs to make (each sign is .95)</li>
            <li>What price to charge for each sandwich</li>
        </ul>

        <!--paragraph transition-->
        <p>Habib has left you with $50.00 (assets). The cost to make one shawarma sandwich
        is .50 (this may change in the future).</p>
        <p>Expenses are sum of producing a sandwich and the cost of signs. Profits are the difference
        between the income from shawarma sales and your expenses. Number of shawarma sandwiches you sell
        each day depends on price you charge, and the number of signs you use. Keep track of assest because you
        can't spend money you don't have. Press enter to play</p>
